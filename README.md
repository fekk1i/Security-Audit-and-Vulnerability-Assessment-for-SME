# Security Audit and Vulnerability Assessment for SME

This project documents a security audit and penetration test conducted on the SME network. The assessment includes vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and a social engineering attack simulation, with the objective of identifying and mitigating potential risks.

## Project Overview:
The audit was performed to evaluate SME’s cybersecurity infrastructure and recommend improvements. This assessment focuses on vulnerabilities in the network and security awareness among employees.

## Contents:
- **Network Scanning**: Tools and scripts used to scan the network for active devices and open ports.
- **Penetration Testing**: Techniques and findings from penetration tests targeting identified vulnerabilities.
- **Social Engineering Case Study**: A phishing attack simulation aimed at SME employees to assess the risk of human-targeted attacks.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Detailed recommendations to enhance the security of the SME infrastructure.

## Key Features:
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Scanning using **Nessus** to identify weaknesses in the network, such as SSH configurations and weak password policies.
- **Penetration Testing**: Exploitation of identified vulnerabilities to demonstrate their impact and provide solutions.
- **Social Engineering**: Simulating phishing attacks to evaluate employee awareness of cybersecurity threats.

## Tools Used:
- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanning tool.
- **Metasploit**: Exploitation framework for penetration testing.
- **Nmap**: Network scanning and port enumeration tool.
- **Hydra**: Password cracking tool for testing weak credentials.

## Key Findings:
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Issues like weak SSH configurations, unencrypted services, and weak passwords were identified.
- **Social Engineering Success**: A phishing attack compromised 5 out of 30 employees, highlighting the need for stronger training and awareness.
- **Mitigation**: Implementation of stronger password policies, improved SSH configurations, and enhanced employee training are recommended.

## Conclusion:
This security audit revealed several areas where SME’s security posture can be improved. The implementation of the recommended measures will significantly reduce the risk of potential cyber-attacks and improve overall network security.
